    Existence lock whose claim expires, so a peer may take it while the previous holder still runs.

    A lease trades mutual exclusion for progress. The holder publishes a claim and refreshes it every
    ``heartbeat_interval`` seconds; a contender takes the marker once it has seen no refresh for ``lease_duration``
    seconds of its own monotonic clock, so clock skew between hosts cannot expire a live claim. Nothing stops the
    expired holder: it keeps running, and it keeps using whatever the lock protects. Treat the lease as a hint about
    who *should* be working, not as a guarantee that only one worker is.

    To make a protected resource reject a superseded holder, that resource must be linearizable and must fence on a
    monotonic generation it controls. :attr:`token` names a claim; it does not fence one. Where overlap is unacceptable,
    use :class:`StrictSoftFileLock <filelock.StrictSoftFileLock>` instead.

    Every contender for a path must agree on ``lease_duration``. A contender that finds a claim published under a
    different duration raises :class:`LeaseSettingsMismatch <filelock.LeaseSettingsMismatch>` rather than apply its own
    expiry to a peer that never agreed to it.

    Expiry reclaims less on Windows, which refuses to rename or delete a file another process holds open. A peer there
    takes an expired claim only once the previous holder's process exits and its handle closes; a holder that lives on
    but stops refreshing keeps the marker. Unix reclaims the marker either way.

    ``on_compromise`` fires from the heartbeat thread when a refresh fails, or when the marker vanishes or names another
    owner. The holder should stop touching the protected resource when it runs. Because it runs on that thread, a
    ``release()`` inside it only takes effect when the lease was built with ``thread_local=False``; the default
    thread-local context hides the claim from every thread but the one that acquired it, so the release does nothing.
    Signal the acquiring thread instead when the context stays thread-local.
